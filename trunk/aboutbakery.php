<br>
<br>
Our story begins in 1994 with a passion for creating beautiful and delicious birthday and wedding cakes.  The same passion still exists more than a decade later.  At Wild Flour Bakery, our number one priority is creating the perfect cake (or cupcakes!  or cookies!) for you.  Every order, whether it is a 5 tier cake or small cookie tray, receives personal attention from our staff to  make sure that it exceeds your expectations in taste, quality, and appearance.  We work hard to keep a consistent flavor in all of our treats, and everything is always made fresh.
<br>
<br>
We offer a wide variety of tastes both unique and familiar for our cakes as well as several of types and sizes of cookies, tarts, and other treats.
<br>
<br>
At Wild Flour Bakery, we belive that baked goods can never be too delicious, too fresh, or too attractive.  To that end, we are always willing to mix and match flavors and fillings and decorate our cakes and cookies to make them as perfect for you as possible.  We understand that how a cake looks is almost as important as how it tastes; it is, after all, the appearance of a cake that makes our eyes go wide and our mouths water.  Check out our <a href="virtualflavor.php">Virtual Flavor</a> gallery to see the look and texture of our cake flavors.
