We have a fantastic team of people who help create everything you see on our website and provide the bright, cheery atmosphere of our bakery.  Each person will happily give you the attention you deserve whether on the phone or in person.  We are very proud of our whole staff!

Our three Fearless Leaders:
<br>
<br>
<b>Sue,</b> <i>Owner</i>
<br>
Sue's educational background is in French grammar and linguistics.  She is self-taught in the arts of baking and cake design.  She set ought to create a neighborhood  bakery that would specialize in cakes to celebrate joyous moments in everyone's lives.  Sue is proud to have been named one of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nawbo.org/">NAWBO's</a> Top Ten Women Business Owners</b> (2004).
<br>
<br>
<b>Mona,</b> <i>Baker Extraordinaire</i>
<br>
Be sure to ask Mona how she and Sue met.  A chance meeting has led to more than ten years of tending the Wild Flour ovens!  Mona is also a self-taught baker who balances our daily baking, tends to our administrative chores, <i>and</i> is a grandmother of seven!
<br>
<br>
<b>Karly,</b> <i>Decorator</i>
<br>
A degree in Spanish education and love of the media arts led Karly to Wild Flour.  She is our color wizard and artist in residence.  Karly is now exploring the wonders of photography and her works can be seen in galleries around town.
